# Analysis of PubMed articles    
Implementation of different Unsupervised ML algorithms.    
  
### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to analyze 10 years of PubMed data for the keywords: 'Obesity', 'Influenza', 'Cancer', 'Mental Health', 'Covid-19', 'Wearable' and answer below questions:  
1. What are some knowledge that can be extracted from trajectory of these research works in a duration of ~10 years.  
2. What are most frequent focus of academia based on research keyword, and how does this focus changed over the year.  
3. What are the sentiments about particular keywords, which one are positive, which one are negative. What is the sentiment trajectory during 10 years period?  
4. What are similar research works that can be identified by algorithm?  

  
### Project Deliverables:   
 • Area Plot for analyzing trajectory of these keywords frequency over 10 years.  
 • #*AFINN algorithm* - Sentiment Analysis  
 • *Kruskal Wallis & Mann Whitney U algorithms* - Non-Parmetric Statistical Tests    
 • *LDA* - Clustering and visualizing its results using Dendrogram  
 • *Apriori algorithm* - Association Rule Mining     
  
### Technical Requirements:  
•	Python 3.7.6  
•	Sklearn 0.23.2  
•	Pandas 1.0.1  
•	Matplotlib 3.1.3
